Here is a frequently asked question I have been getting recently:

"It says I do not have permission to view the dropped assessment"

You would see this message if you tried to take the assessment at the end of Unit 2 Lesson 17. **This is because the Unit Tests for Biology are not in Connexus.** You can find the link to the Unit 2 Test on the Message Board or [here on the announcments page](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/unit-2-final-test/).

When you are done with the Unit 2 Test, you can mark lesson 17 complete.
