We all know there has been a lot of bad news lately regarding the environment. And we tend to focus on the bad news stories. Of course, its important to know about those stories. But even 2020 has its fair share of good news - and it's important to know about those stories, too!

Here are examples of two good news stories:

* [Wind-powered cargo ships](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/oceanbird-prototype-cuts-cargo-ship-emissions-by-90pt/){:target="_blank"}
* [New habitats for chimpanzees](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/uganda-is-planting-3-million-trees-for-chimpanzees/){:target="_blank"}

See if you can do some brief research of your own about good environmental or ecological news. Write a summary and include your own comments about the article you found. Here is a good place to start: [Good News Network](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/more/about-us/){:target="_blank"}. I'll make a post sharing everyone's articles in a week or so. Oh, and extra credit for this? Possibly... but isn't reading and sharing good stories already motivation? :)
