Some of you may be encountering this message when you try to do your next lesson in Biology:

> "You may not view or submit this assessment until you submit all previous assessments."

There are two reasons why this might be happening.

<hr>

### Reason 1 - This is the most likley reason!

*You have not completed your last Unit Test.*

* For example, if you are working through Unit 3 but have not completed the Unit 2 Test, you must go back and take the Unit 2 Test first. **Once you have done so, let your teacher know so that they can allow you to move on as soon as possible.**
* [Click here to go to the Unit Tests.]({{site.baseurl}}/categories#Tests)
* **Don't take the "regular" text in Connexus. Make sure you take the "Test Alternative" by clicking the link above**

<hr>

### Reason 2 - This is much less likely. First make sure you completed your last Unit Test.

*You have accidentally skipped a lesson.* 

* [Look at your course tree]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-see-course-tree/) to be sure that you are on the correct lesson.
