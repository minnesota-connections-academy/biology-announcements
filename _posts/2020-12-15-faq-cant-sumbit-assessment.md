Some of you may be encountering this message when you try to do your next lesson in Biology:

> "You may not view or submit this assessment until you submit all previous assessments."

There are two reasons why this might be happening.

1. (Most likely) You have not completed your last Unit Test. For example, if you are working through Unit 3 but have not completed the Unit 2 Test, you must go back and take the Unit 2 Test first. **Once you have done so, let your teacher know so that they can allow you to move on as soon as possible.**
2. (Less likely but possible) You have accidentally skipped a lesson. [Look at your course tree]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-see-course-tree/) to be sure that you are on the correct lesson.
