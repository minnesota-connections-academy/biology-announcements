A few very important announcements:

(1) There is no Unit 4 Test or Final Exam this semester for Biology. Both of these things have been dropped.

(2) The last day of the first semester is January 27th! Please check to make sure that you have these four imporant things completed:

* [Unit 2 Portfolio](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/biodiversity-portfolio/)
* [Unit 2 Test](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/unit-2-final-test/)
* [Unit 3 Portfolio](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/unit-3-portfolio/)
* [Unit 3 Test](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/unit-3-final-test/)

(3) Thank you to everyone who has created an animation about a Biology topic! If you want to [submit an animation for extra credit](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/animation-assignment/), you can still do so. Please send it to your teacher in WebMail by the end of the day on January 27th at the latest! Mr. Sweeney will put together a collection of everyone's work after the deadline is over.
