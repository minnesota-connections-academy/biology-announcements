This is another 2 day lesson. So make sure you take your time with it! As such there is quite a bit of material in this lesson so let's break it down with some helpful videos.

First, we have a video from Khan Academy that discusses much of what is on slide 2. As you watch the video, consider the following:

> What were the major contributions that led to the growing understanding of cells?

> What are the three principles that make up the cell theory?

Next. There are two types of living things on this Earth. Things that like science and things that dislike science. Chemistry Cat likes science.

No, just kidding. But there really are two types of living things on this Earth. We can categorize living things as either eukaryotes or prokaryotes. Literally every living thing is either one or the other. You might be surprised to know that an oak tree and a human are both in the same category!

Here is another video from our beloved Amoeba Sisters discussing the difference between these two categories. As you watch, note the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (there is a t-chart ready for you to use if you are using the guided notes). Don't forget to include examples! That is the best way to remember.

Alright, we are starting to get a picture of what cells are. Most living things that we are familiar with (trees, cats, dinosaurs) are multicellular - made up of lots and lots of cells. Cells are kind of like the Lego pieces that make up a living thing. Your skin is made up of tons and tons of skin cells, for instance. Although, keep in mind that some living things are only made of one cell. 

That's enough for today. Tomorrow I will post a couple things to help us better grasp the size of cells.
