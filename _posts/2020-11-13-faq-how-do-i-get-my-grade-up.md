A very frequent question we teachers get is, "Hey Ms. Ruble/Ms. Johnston/Mr. Sweeney, how do I improve my grade?"

First off, we are very happy that you want to improve your grade, because that means you want to learn more about Biology. But before you ask how you can improve your grade, make sure that you have done everything listed here.

### How to get your grade up

1. Have you spoken to your Biology teacher yet? 
   * If you haven't talked on the phone or met one on one in LiveLesson with your teacher, you *should* book a meeting:
     * [Book a meeting with Ms. Johnston](https://emily-johnston.youcanbook.me){:target="_blank"}
     * [Book a meeting with Ms. Ruble](http://larublemnca.youcanbook.me){:target="_blank"}
     * [Book a meeting with Mr. Sweeney](https://jasweeney.youcanbook.me/){:target="_blank"}
2. Are you missing anything? Check your grade book for any zeros. Things that are frequently missing:
   * [Unit Tests](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/categories#Tests)
   * [Portfolios](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/categories#Portfolios)
3. Are you unhappy with a quiz score?
   * Have you taken the [alternative quiz](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/categories#Alternative-Quizzes)? Your alternative quiz scores could replace the regular Connexus quiz scores.
   * Have you done [specific revision options like this](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/Wolves-the-quintessential-keystone-species/)?
   * Have you followed [the retake instructions?](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/retake-information/)
4. Are you unhappy with your Unit 2 portfolio (biodiversity lab) score?
   * First, make sure you did the correct assignment. There were two options for this portfolio: [the standard option](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/biodiversity-portfolio/) and [the alternative option](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/Unit-2-Alternative-Portfolio-Option/).
   * You can always improve your score. Check [your feedback](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/how-to-see-feedback/) and make revisions. Then send your updated revision to your teacher as [an attachment in webmail](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/how-to-send-a-webmail-with-an-attachment/).
5. Are you unhappy with your Unit 3 portfolio (cell size lab) score?
   * First, make sure you did the correct assignment. The instructions for the assignment are here: [Unit 3 Portfolio](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/unit-3-portfolio/) along with helpful videos and recordings.
   * You can always improve your score. Check [your feedback](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/how-to-see-feedback/) and make revisions. Then send your updated revision to your teacher as [an attachment in webmail](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/how-to-send-a-webmail-with-an-attachment/).
6. Are you unhappy with a Unit Test score?
   * Have you followed [the retake instructions?](https://sweeneyscience.github.io/biology-announcements/retake-information/)
