The short answer question on Unit 2 Lesson 8 quiz was a difficult one. 

> Describe what happens when a keystone species is removed from an ecosystem.

Actually, the problem is that the question is a bit vague. Many of you got 0 or 1 points on this question - but, to be fair, I'm grading this question pretty tough. That's because I want you to consider the *specific* details of the effects that a keystone species has on its ecosystem. Of course, we know that a keystone species is important and that it keeps its ecosystem in "balance". But what this question means to ask is *how* does it keep the ecosystem in balance.

Now, think about this question and write a response:

> How does the presence of the wolves affect both the living and the non-living things in Yellowstone? 

Note - you can write your answer casually. Imagine you are describing what you learned from this video to a friend.
