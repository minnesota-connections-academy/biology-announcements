The short answer question on Unit 2 Lesson 8 quiz was a difficult one. 

> Describe what happens when a keystone species is removed from an ecosystem.

Many of you got 0 or 1 points on this question - but, to be fair, I'm grading this question pretty tough. That's because I want you to consider the *specific* details of the effects that a keystone species has on its ecosystem. Of course, we know that a keystone species is important and that it keeps its ecosystem in "balance". I don't want you to just give the definition of a keystone species. I want you to describe *how* a keystone species keeps its ecosystem in balance. Describe the chain of events that could occur if a keystone species were to disappear from its ecosystem.

### Here's the good news.

**As always** you can earn points back on quizzes in Biology. Here's how you can with this question.

First, watch this video.

Now, think about this question and write a response:

> How does the presence of the wolves affect both the living and the non-living things in Yellowstone? 

Note - you can write your answer casually. Imagine you are describing what you learned from this video to a friend.
