Hello wonderful Biology students,

Every now and then I like to share a relevant video or article regarding the bizarre world of Biology.

In LiveLesson this past Wednesday, Ms. Ruble shared some examples of *symbiotic* relationships between organisms. Here's a hilarious/adorable example of a *mutualisitc* relationship between a type of fish and a type of shrimp. If you have time, take 5 minutes to watch this video:

Also, in case you missed LiveLesson this past week, [here is the recording.](http://www.connexus.com/external/livelesson/?url-path=pht9mk5w10ub&domain=ww3.livelesson.com)

One last thing, tomorrow I am hosting an extra Bio Help Session **in my LL room**. Check your planner for the time.

PS - wondering why how the Pistol Shrimp got its name? It's because it can literally stun its prey with super sonic bubbles.
