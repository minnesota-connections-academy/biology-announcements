Two things.

1. You may have noticed that the link to the Bio Small Group Session today did not work (if you were copying and pasting it from your planner). I've fixed this now so you shouldn't have a problem getting into the LL room in the future. Here is the recording from today's session.

2. Let's talk **Participation grade.** Each Unit (Unit 2, 3, and 4) you will have a participation score worth 20 quick check points each. You earn your participation credit by coming to *and participating in* at least one small group session per Unit. If you come and participate in more, you can earn bonus points.

Note. Small group LL sessions are Mondays at 10:00 to 10:30 AM. However, sometimes I will host bonus sessions on Fridays (such as last Friday). I'll always send out a webmail if this is the case.

Please reach out if you have any questions. 

Bye!
