### Welcome to the wonderful world of BIOLOGY!!

I’m Mr. Sweeney, and I am thrilled to have you as part of my class!  

All class resources and contact information can be found on the class [Message Board!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQgYKwh6Z7otnCtLliczTrL5AObiFt1U9-DiZ_uN34Tkf-MrjFHu12DGTLOKoPBDG8DaKOv7F7ptiBV/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

**Please note**: It is REQUIRED as a student here to talk with me a minimum of once per semester.  If I can’t reach you, it makes it hard for me to be your teacher.  I want to be there for you, and get to know you! 


### Classroom Policies:

You can ALWAYS increase your grade on a quiz or portfolio.  Message me to learn how when you need to. 

You can USE YOUR NOTES on assessments.  NOT the Internet. 

CONTACT ME when you need something! 

If you have a question, you can call or text me at 612-293-9129. You can also book a time to meet me in my LiveLesson room with this website here: [https://jasweeney.youcanbook.me](https://jasweeney.youcanbook.me) 

[What is a LiveLesson room anyway?](whats-a-live-lesson-room)

Looking forward to this semester! 

Mr. Sweeney
