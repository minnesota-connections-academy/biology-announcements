### Welcome to the wonderful world of BIOLOGY!!

All class resources and contact information can be found on the class [Message Board!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQgYKwh6Z7otnCtLliczTrL5AObiFt1U9-DiZ_uN34Tkf-MrjFHu12DGTLOKoPBDG8DaKOv7F7ptiBV/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

**Please note**: It is REQUIRED as a student here to talk with me a minimum of once per semester.  If I canâ€™t reach you, it makes it hard for me to be your teacher.  I want to be there for you, and get to know you! 


### Classroom Policies:

You can ALWAYS increase your grade on a quiz or portfolio.  Message me to learn how when you need to. 

You can USE YOUR NOTES on assessments.  NOT the Internet. 

CONTACT ME when you need something! 

If you have a question, you can call or text your Biology teacher (either Ms. Johnston, Ms. Ruble, or Mr. Sweeney). You can also book a time to meet in our LiveLesson rooms.

* [Book a meeting with Ms. Johnston](https://emily-johnston.youcanbook.me)
* [Book a meeting with Ms. Ruble](http://larublemnca.youcanbook.me)
* [Book a meeting with Mr. Sweeney](https://jasweeney.youcanbook.me)

[What is a LiveLesson room anyway?]({{ site.baseurl }}/whats-a-livelesson-room)

We are looking forward to this semester!

Sincerely, your MNCA Biology teachers
