Sorry for the title of this post yelling at you.

But, quickly, here are some very important things about the portfolio assignment in Unit 2 Lesson 12.

First, here are the materials you will need:

* bag of skittles (or fruit candy of different colors)
* bag of M&M’s (or chocolate candy of different colors)

Yum.

If you can not get these things, that is okay! You can get creative and use legos, beads, colored pieces of paper, etc.

### Next really important thing to read

[This is the handout you will complete and submit!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwgijjGuQkm5WRwUVuOLUMlGk29NbM8LniSVbmI5BFA/edit?usp=sharing) Don't download and use the handout that is in the lesson.

The handout that I want you to complete has fewer questions than the one that is linked to on page 3 of Lesson 12. Yay! You'll also notice there is a handy portfolio guide recording right at the top of the handout. Nice.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
