Watch this video from Khan Academy to help better understand the concepts of *energy pyramid*s, and *nutrient cycles*. These concepts are discussed in more detail on the *Instructions* slides of Lessons 3 and 4 in Unit 2.

Keep these questions in mind as you watch the video.

> 1. What is a trophic level?
> 2. According to the law of conservation of energy, energy is not created and not destroyed; there is a constant amount of energy in the universe. What happens to the energy that is not retained in each trophic level as it flows through an ecosystem?
> 3. How does the movement of matter compare to the movement of energy through an ecosystem?
