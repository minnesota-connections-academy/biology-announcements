Don't forget! This is another two day lesson, so don't try to cram everything into one day.

Last lesson we learned what cells are and just how tiny they are. Now we'll learn more about *how* they work by taking a look at the even tiny-tinier structures inside of cells. Just like a body has *organs* that allow a body to function. A cell has *organelles* that allow the cell to function. Below I have linked to several great resources to help you complete your notes on the organelles.

### Resources

**Keep in mind**, you don't have to watch all of these resources. In fact, you shouldn't watch all of them, because that would take far too much time. I hope that you choose what you find most useful. 

First off, Ms. Ruble's [LiveLesson this week](http://www.connexus.com/external/livelesson/?url-path=ptkwpatg2gls&domain=ww3.livelesson.com) was particularly fantastic. Of course, Ms Ruble's LiveLessons are always fantastic.

These three videos from Khan Academy are already on slide 3 of this lesson but, for your convenience, I will link to them again here.

* [The Nucleus](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/cells/eukaryotic-cells/v/the-nucleus)
* [Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-cells/hs-eukaryotic-cell-structures/v/organelles-in-eukaryotic-cells)
* [Overview of Animal and Plant Cells](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/cytoskeleton-junctions-and-extracellular-structures/v/overview-of-animal-and-plant-cells)

The Amoeba Sisters have a fun overview of cells as well.

And finally, Crash Course goes into greater detail with both plant and animal cells. Plus, it's fun to laugh out loud and learn Biology at the same time.
