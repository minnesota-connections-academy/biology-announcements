The Biology Message Board lives on a Google Slides presentation. But you can always get there by clicking on the blue push pin icon on the Connexus menu.

You will have to click on "Biology A" again and then "Biology Message Board" until you reach a page that looks like this:

You will see the link to both the Announcements Page and the Message Board here. Bookmark this page so that it is easy for you to get back here.

Hint: It's a good idea to create a bookmark for all of your classes' Message Boards.
