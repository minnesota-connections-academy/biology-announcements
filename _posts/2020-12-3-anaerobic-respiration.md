Let's remind ourselves of the chemical equation for cellular respiration for a quick minute:

![Cellular respiration equation](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4eMrAce6PWY/VCtmvYFzrBI/AAAAAAAAma8/sMk9OHavwUA/s1600/Screen%2520Shot%25202014-09-30%2520at%25201.13.44%2520PM.png)

Notice how oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is a reactant. Cellular respiration requires oxygen. Actually, to be more accurate, *aerobic* cellular respiration requires oxygen ("aerobic" means "in the presence of oxygen"). *Anaerobic* respiration does not require oxygen ("anaerobic" is the opposite of "aerobic").

Your red blood cells supply your cells with oxygen molecules. But if you are working out, or going for a run, or dancing vigorously...

there is a chance your cells start to run low on oxygen.

So cells need a back-up plan when oxygen is in low supply. That's where anaerobic respiration comes in, which by the way, is more commonly known as *fermentation*. Multicellular animals (like us) do fermentation and so do other things like bacteria and yeast. Fermentation is famous in particular with yeast because yeast uses the process to turn sugars (glucose) into alchohol.

Mr. Anderson from Bozeman Science has a very clear explanation of the process of fermentation. The Amoeba Sisters have a good video as well. Using these videos for help, I challenge you to create a diagram of the process of fermenation that demonstrates the steps and the molecules involved. And the diagram to your notes.
