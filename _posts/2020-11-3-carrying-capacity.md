Sometimes I will provide helpful videos here on the announcements page to help you better understand complicated concepts in Biology. Also, sometimes watching a video can be much more helpful than reading a long article. For example, if you don't want to read the [Scholastic GO! article on Populations and Communities](https://go.scholastic.com/I/article/444/446/4444465.html?ucn=610753097&cred=Y2FsbGN8Y2FsbGM){:target="_blank"}, you can instead watch one of the following videos.

First we have a video from [youtube Biology teacher sensation](https://www.bozemanscience.com/about){:target="_blank"}, Mr. Anderson at Bozeman Science. He does a great job of breaking down the concept of why populations don't continue to grow forever. This concept is known as "carrying capacity." Now, the video gets pretty technical at around the 5:40 mark so don't feel like you have to watch the whole thing. If you are feeling up for it, go ahead.

Next is a video from my good friend (just kidding - I wish he was though) Hank Green at [Crash Course](https://thecrashcourse.com/about){:target="_blank"}. This video covers pretty much the same thing but with more humor.
