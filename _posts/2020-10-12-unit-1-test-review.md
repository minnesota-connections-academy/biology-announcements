Good morning wonderful Biology students,

A frequently asked question over the weekend has been: "Hello Mr. Sweeney, how can I get my grade up?"

I appreciate that many of you are dedicated to improving your grade and therefore your understanding of Biology. As of now, much of your grade is determined by your Unit 1 Test score. **If you wish to improve your Unit 1 Test score, please feel free to come to my LiveLesson room tomorrow (Oct 13th) at 2:00 PM. We will be working on reviewing the Unit 1 Test.** If you can't make it, let me know and I can provide you with instructions on how to review the test on your own.

Here are couple of other things to consider about the question "How do I improve my grade?"

- Keep in mind that I am still working on transferring your grades from the previous course. This likely means that your grade looks somewhat lower than it should.
- We are very early in the course. Even if you did not do splendidly on your Unit 1 Test, your grade will likely improve as you continue to work through the course. Your Unit 1 Test will not end up counting much towards your final grade.

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you have any questions.
