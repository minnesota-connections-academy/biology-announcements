Some living things are just one cell. The lonely amoeba lives its life as a single cell. Wandering about. Gobbling up a paramecium every now and then.

But more complex living things, like a human, are made up of many cells. Trillions upon trillions of cells. All those cells are living things - just like the amoeba is a living thing. So you can sort of think of your body as trillions of little living things all cooperating together to make up you. Fun!

Whether you are an amoeba or a human, your cells need stuff. And that's the point of this lesson. Living things need stuff. So with that in mind, there are two main questions I want you to focus on for this lesson.

> What types of things does a cell need to transport into and out of itself? More specifically, what *molecules* does a cell need to transport in and out?
>
> Do cells transport all types of molecules the same way? (Hint - no, they don't.) Why are there different modes of transportation?

Lesson 3 has a lot of information and activities. It is okay if you don't complete it all in one day. There already are good videos in the lesson as well as two Gizmos. These are great resources and make sure to spend some time with them. I've linked to them here again for your convenience.
