Two videos for these two lessons! Keep in mind these questions as you watch:

> How do bacteria make you ill?
> 
> Not all bacteria are bad! What are some important roles that bacteria play in ecosystems and in our bodies?

Mostly, these lessons are about bacteria. Bacteria are a type of prokaryote. There is one other group of prokaryotes, though - archaea! Archaea don't get much attention because they don't make us sick. They are very interesting, though, and therefore worth learning about.
